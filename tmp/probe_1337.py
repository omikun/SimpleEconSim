"""Reproduce the BANK INSOLVENCY exception on seed 1337 (single ring, 300 turns).

The M1 gate (behavior_drift.py) now fails here after the _buy clamp fix:
  seed=1337: EXCEPTION RuntimeError: BANK INSOLVENCY: write-down would make
  deposits negative

This standalone probe runs seed 1337 WITHOUT swallowing exceptions so the
full traceback (with the exact bank write-down site) is printed.

Usage:
